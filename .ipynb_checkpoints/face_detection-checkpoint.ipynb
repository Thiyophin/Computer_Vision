    "#### OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is widely used for computer vision tasks, including face detection. However, OpenCV is typically not used for training deep learning models from scratch (such as face detection models). Instead, OpenCV provides pre-trained models, primarily based on deep learning frameworks, which can be used to detect faces in images and videos.\n",

    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow\n",
    "- **Overview**: TensorFlow offers the **Object Detection API**, which simplifies training face detection models, especially when using pre-trained models.\n",
    "- **Key Feature**: TensorFlow provides high-level tools for training and deploying object detection models, and it is widely used in both research and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caffe\n",
    "- **Overview**: Caffe is a deep learning framework that allows training custom models for face detection, but it requires more manual setup compared to other frameworks.\n",
    "- **Key Feature**: Caffe is known for its performance and efficiency in image classification and is used in some object detection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras\n",
    "- **Overview**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API that simplifies model creation. It runs on top of TensorFlow.\n",
